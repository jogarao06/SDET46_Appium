For native apps, please try to avoid using XPath. XPath is fragile, slow and bound to change with minor UI updates in the application. A single UI update and many XPaths will get impacted if not optimized.

If you really want to use XPath, please write optimized XPaths. 

If elements cannot be identified using unique IDs, please request your application development team to add those as much as possible.

Also, iOS Predicate Strings and Class Chains are very good alternatives to XPath. Appium Inspector automatically suggests these in most of the cases. So prefer these over XPath.

For Android , it's still ok to use XPath for elements where resource-id is not available, but for iOS, please avoid as much as possible.

For Hybrid apps, prefer CSS over XPath if elements cannot be identified using unique IDs.
